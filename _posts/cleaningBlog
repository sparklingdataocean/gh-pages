About word2vec
a suite of algorithms
for unsupervised training
of dense vector representations of words
on large corpora.
Resulting embeddings have been shown (Mikolov and Dean 2013) to capture semantic word similarity as well as more complex semantic relationships through linear vector manipulation,
