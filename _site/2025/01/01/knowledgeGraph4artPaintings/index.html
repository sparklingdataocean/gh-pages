				<p><h2>Introduction: Knowledge Graphs Exploration</h2>

Art and artists are deeply connected, reflecting creativity, culture, and history. Graphs provide a powerful way to explore these relationships by representing artists, artworks, and movements as nodes, and their connections as edges. This helps us uncover patterns, find hidden links, and better understand the evolution of art. With advanced tools like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we can predict new connections, group related ideas, and gain even deeper insights into the art world.

<p><h3>Building on Our Previous Research</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
The first study, titled <strong>"Building Knowledge Graph in Spark without SPARQL"</strong>, was presented at the DEXA 2020 online conference. It explored non-traditional methods for constructing and analyzing knowledge graphs, moving beyond SPARQL-based semantic web approaches. The study demonstrated how the Spark GraphFrames library could be leveraged to efficiently build and mine knowledge graphs. Focusing on modern art artists, it highlighted the versatility and scalability of knowledge graph techniques.

<i><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344329097_Building_Knowledge_Graph_in_Spark_Without_SPARQL">
paper</a></i>
where we showed how to build knowledge graph in Spark without SPARQL and how conceptually knowledge graph builds a bridge between logical thinking and graph thinking for data mining.
<p></p>
<p>
The second study was presented at <strong>ICAART 2023: 22-24 February, 2023 in Lisbon</strong>. It focused on methods for rewiring knowledge graphs to uncover hidden relationships between nodes using GNN link prediction models. The experiments analyzed semantic similarities and dissimilarities between the biographies of modern art artists by utilizing Wikipedia articles. A traditional method used the full text of articles and cosine similarities between re-embedded nodes, while a novel method examined the distribution of co-located words within and across articles. Output vectors from the GNN link prediction model were aggregated by artist, and link predictions were calculated based on cosine similarities.
</p>
<p>
The study highlighted the importance of both highly connected and highly disconnected node pairs in graph mining. Disconnected pairs offered unique insights, revealing the knowledge graph's overall coverage and serving as indicators for validating community detection. Additionally, the study demonstrated practical applications for rewired knowledge graphs in recommender systems. High-similarity node pairs suggested related artists or movements, while high-dissimilarity pairs encouraged users to explore contrasting art movements, enhancing the diversity of recommendations.

<p><h3>This Study</h3>
<p></p>



<p></p>

The dataset, <i><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time">
'Best Artworks of All Time'</a></i>, was taken from Kaggle. It features information and artwork images from 50 of the most influential artists in history. The dataset includes detailed artist metadata sourced from Wikipedia, as well as a collection of high-resolution images scraped from artchallenge.ru.
<p></p>

This study focuses on the <strong>Construction of a Unified Knowledge Graph</strong> to analyze the relationships between artists and their works. Starting with raw data comprising artist biographies and painting images, two separate graphs are created: an <strong>Artist Graph</strong> and a <strong>Painting Graph</strong>.
<p></p>
Textual data from artist biographies is transformed into vectors using Large Language Models (LLMs), while visual data from painting images is processed into vectors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These initial embeddings are further refined through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to produce consistent, high-quality representations for the nodes in both graphs.
<p></p>
The final step involves combining the Artist Graph and Painting Graph into a single <strong>Unified Knowledge Graph</strong>, where links represent the connections between artists and their respective works. This integrated graph provides a robust framework for exploring the intricate relationships within the art world, enabling tasks such as classification, clustering, and link prediction.

<p><h2>Methods</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Graph Construction for Artists</h3>

<p>
The process of constructing a graph to represent artist relationships begins with defining nodes for each artist and creating edges based on shared attributes such as genre and nationality.
</p>

<p>
Each artist is represented as a node in the graph, with attributes like the artist's index and name. To capture relationships:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Genre-Based Edges:</strong> Edges are added between all pairs of artists who share the same genre, reflecting thematic or stylistic connections.</li>
  <li><strong>Nationality-Based Edges:</strong> Edges are created between artists who share the same nationality, representing cultural or geographical ties.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To enable analysis, the graph’s edges are converted into a DataFrame, organized with columns for source nodes, target nodes, and edge attributes. If the edge attributes are stored as dictionaries, these are expanded into individual columns for easier interpretation. The resulting DataFrame is reviewed to confirm its accuracy and structure.
</p>

<h4>Transforming Text to Vectors for Node Features</h4>

<p>
Artist biographies are transformed into vector embeddings to enrich the graph with semantic information. Using the Hugging Face <i><a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'</a></i> model, the text is encoded into a 384-dimensional vector space, producing a tensor of size <code>[50, 384]</code>, where each row represents an artist.
</p>

<p>
These embeddings are assigned as node features in the graph using the <code>ndata['feat']</code> attribute. This enables:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using vectors as input for GNN link prediction models.</li>
  <li>Generating additional graph edges by calculating a cosine similarity matrix and selecting highly connected vector pairs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This approach provides a robust foundation for graph-based analysis, capturing both semantic relationships and potential hidden connections between artists.
</p>

</p><p>

</p><p>
<p><h4>Run GNN Link Prediction Model</h4>
</p><p>

As Graph Neural Networks link prediction we used a model from Deep Graph Library (DGL). The model is built on two GrapgSAGE layers  and computes node representations by averaging neighbor information.

We used the code provided by DGL tutorial <i><a href="https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.8.x/tutorials/blitz/4_link_predict.html">DGL Link Prediction using Graph Neural Networks</a></i>.

</p><p>

The results of this code are embedded nodes that can be used for further analysis such as node classification, k-means clustering, link prediction and so on. In this study we used it for link prediction by estimating cosine similarities between embedded nodes.
<p></p>

<h3>Building the Painting Graph</h3>
<p>
To construct a graph representing paintings, artwork files are processed to link paintings to their respective artists and prepare the data for graph creation. Each painting is assigned a unique <code>File Index</code>, and artist names extracted from file names are mapped to their corresponding <code>Artist Index</code> using <code>artists_df</code>. This information—<code>File Name</code>, <code>Artist Name</code>, <code>File Index</code>, and <code>Artist Index</code>—is combined into a structured DataFrame.
</p>
<p>
The Painting Graph is created where nodes represent paintings and edges connect paintings by the same artist. Using NetworkX, nodes are added with their <code>File Index</code> as identifiers and <code>File Name</code> as attributes. Edges are added between paintings that share the same <code>Artist Index</code>, capturing relationships based on shared creators.
</p>

<h4>Image Features for Node Embeddings</h4>
<p>
Painting images are processed to generate visual embeddings using a pre-trained CNN, such as ResNet. Images are resized, normalized, and passed through the model to extract high-dimensional feature vectors. These embeddings are stored as node features, enriching the graph with visual content for machine learning tasks.
</p>

<h4>Transforming the Painting Graph to DGL Format</h4>
<p>
The Painting Graph is converted into DGL format to facilitate efficient processing and modeling using DGL's graph-based machine learning tools. The edges from <code>painting_graph_edges</code> are transformed into a PyTorch tensor, defining the graph's structure. Self-loops are added to ensure each node is connected to itself, which can enhance the performance of GNN models.
</p>
<p>
Image feature vectors, previously saved and loaded from storage, are assigned as node features in the graph. These embeddings are converted into a PyTorch tensor and set using the <code>ndata['feat']</code> attribute, enriching the graph with meaningful visual data for each painting node.
</p>

<h4>GNN Link Prediction Model Training for the Painting Graph</h4>
<p>
The GNN model is trained for link prediction on the Painting Graph using the constructed graph and its visual embeddings. Similar to the Artist Graph, the training process involves predicting links by leveraging the node features, allowing the model to identify relationships between paintings based on shared visual or contextual patterns. This tailored approach reveals hidden connections and enhances the understanding of painting relationships within the graph.
</p>

<h3>Unified Knowledge Graph</h3>


<p>
To analyze relationships between artists and their works, we created a Unified Knowledge Graph by combining the Artist graph and Painting graph. This integration enables consistent multi-modal data embedding and analysis.
</p>

<p>
Artist biographies were transformed into 384-dimensional vectors using a transformer model, then reduced to 128-dimensional embeddings through GNN link prediction. Paintings were similarly represented as 2048-dimensional vectors using a pre-trained CNN model, which were also reduced to 128-dimensional embeddings.
</p>

<p>
To unify the graphs, unique indices ensured no overlap between artist and painting nodes, with artist nodes offset by 1000. Painting file names were processed to map each painting to its corresponding artist, and edges were added to represent these relationships.
</p>

<p>
The resulting Unified Knowledge Graph integrates artist and painting data into a single structure, providing a foundation for advanced graph-based analysis.
</p>

<h4>GNN Link Prediction Model for the Unified Graph</h4>
<p>
<p>We applied the GNN Link Prediction model three times across different stages of the study:</p>

<p><strong>1. Artist Graph:</strong> The model was used to process artist biographies, initially embedded as 384-dimensional vectors derived from text data. The GNN Link Prediction model reduced these embeddings to a consistent size of 128 dimensions, capturing semantic relationships between artists effectively.</p>

<p><strong>2. Painting Graph:</strong> For paintings, visual features extracted via a CNN model were initially represented as 2048-dimensional vectors. The GNN Link Prediction model was applied to reduce these high-dimensional embeddings to 128 dimensions, emphasizing meaningful stylistic or thematic connections between paintings.</p>

<p><strong>3. Unified Knowledge Graph:</strong> After merging the Artist and Painting graphs into a single structure, the GNN Link Prediction model was run again on the unified graph. This step refined the node embeddings, ensuring consistent 128-dimensional representations across all nodes while integrating multi-modal relationships between artists and their works.</p>

<p>By running the model at each stage, we achieved consistent embeddings that facilitate advanced graph-based analysis, uncovering complex patterns and relationships within the unified framework.</p>

<h3>Artist Graph</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>Building Graph on Artists</h4>
<p>To construct a graph where nodes represent artists and edges are created based on shared attributes, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Create nodes:</strong> Add a node for each artist using their <code>artistIndex</code> and <code>name</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Create genre-based edges:</strong> For each genre, add edges between all pairs of artists who share that genre.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Create nationality-based edges:</strong> Similarly, for each nationality, add edges between all pairs of artists who share that nationality.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>The following steps describe how to convert graph edges into a DataFrame for analysis:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Convert edges to a DataFrame:</strong> Extract the edges from the graph <code>G</code> and organize them into a DataFrame with columns for source nodes, target nodes, and edge attributes.</li>
  <li><strong>Expand edge attributes:</strong> If the edge attributes are stored as dictionaries, expand these into separate columns to make them more accessible.</li>
  <li><strong>Display the edges DataFrame:</strong> View the resulting DataFrame to verify its structure and content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Python code snippet below demonstrates these steps:</p>

<h4>Transform Text to Vectors</h4>
<p></p>

<p>This section describes how text data, specifically the artist biographies, is transformed into vector embeddings to be used as node features in a graph. We utilized the <code>'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'</code> model from Hugging Face for this purpose, which generates high-quality sentence embeddings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Model Selection:</strong> The <code>'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'</code> model, a lightweight yet powerful transformer, was used for efficient text-to-vector translation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Embedding Creation:</strong> Artist biographies from the DataFrame are encoded into a tensor of size <code>[50, 384]</code>, where each row represents a 384-dimensional vector for an artist.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assigning Features:</strong> These embeddings are assigned as node features to the graph using the <code>ndata['feat']</code> attribute.
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
The Python code below demonstrates the embedding process and assignment to the graph:

<h4>GNN Link Prediction Model Training</h4>
<p>This subsection describes the process of training a GNN link prediction model, using code adapted from the DGL library. The focus is on leveraging the built-in functionalities for implementing and training GNN-based link prediction tasks.</p>
<p>The training pipeline includes constructing positive and negative edge graphs for the training and testing phases, defining the GNN architecture, and training the model using standard techniques. The training concludes with an evaluation of the model's performance using the AUC (Area Under the Curve) metric.</p>

<h3>Paintings Graph</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>Create a Graph on Paintings</h4>
<p>In this subsection, we process artwork files to build a DataFrame that links paintings to their respective artists and prepares data for graph construction.</p>
<p>The following steps outline the workflow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Process files in the directory:</strong> Iterate through the files in the specified directory, extract the painting's file name, artist's name, and assign a unique <code>File Index</code> to each painting.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Match artist names to indices:</strong> The artist names extracted from the file names are mapped to their corresponding <code>Artist Index</code> using a sorted version of the <code>artists_df</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Create the paintings DataFrame:</strong> Combine the extracted file data, including <code>File Name</code>, <code>Artist Name</code>, <code>File Index</code>, and the mapped <code>Artist Index</code>, into a structured DataFrame for further analysis and graph creation.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Initialize and Build the Painting Graph</h4>
<p>This subsection describes the creation of a graph where nodes represent paintings, and edges connect paintings created by the same artist. The graph is then analyzed and converted to DGL format for use in machine learning tasks.</p>
<p>The following steps outline the workflow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Initialize the graph:</strong> Use NetworkX to create an undirected graph.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Add nodes with attributes:</strong> Each painting is added as a node, with its <code>File Index</code> as the identifier and <code>File Name</code> as a node attribute.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Add edges:</strong> Paintings created by the same artist are connected. Edges are added between all pairs of paintings that share the same <code>Artist Index</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Python code below demonstrates the implementation:</p>

<h4>Image Features for Node Embeddings</h4>
<p>In this section, we use a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract feature embeddings from the painting images. These features serve as node embeddings for the graph, enabling the model to capture meaningful visual patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Workflow:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Image Preprocessing:</strong> Images are resized to <code>224x224</code> pixels, converted to tensors, and normalized using standard ImageNet mean and standard deviation values. This ensures compatibility with the pre-trained CNN model.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Each preprocessed image is passed through the CNN (e.g., ResNet) to extract a high-dimensional feature vector. These vectors represent the visual content of the paintings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Embedding Storage:</strong> The extracted feature vector for each image is flattened, converted to a NumPy array, and stored in a dictionary with the file name as the key. This allows easy mapping between the image and its corresponding feature representation.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This process generates a rich set of visual embeddings that can be used as input features for graph-based learning tasks.</p>

<h4>Transforming the Painting Graph to DGL Format</h4>
<p>This subsection describes the process of transforming the painting graph into DGL format, including edge and node feature assignments. This transformation enables efficient processing and modeling using DGL's graph-based machine learning tools.

</a>
<p></p>

<p>Workflow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Create the DGL graph:</strong> The edges from <code>painting_graph_edges</code> are converted into a PyTorch tensor and used to define the graph structure. Self-loops are added to ensure every node has a connection to itself, which can enhance model performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assign node features:</strong> The image embeddings are transformed into a PyTorch tensor and assigned to the graph as node features using the <code>ndata['feat']</code> attribute. This allows the graph to carry meaningful data for each node.
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<p>The following code demonstrates the transformation process:</p>

<p></p>
<p>The resulting graph <code>gPaintings</code> includes 1000 nodes, 10,500 edges, and node features of shape <code>(2048,)</code>. It is now ready for use in graph-based machine learning tasks.</p>

<h4>GNN Link Prediction Model Training for the Painting Graph</h4>
<p></p>
In this subsection, we focus on training a GNN model for link prediction on the painting graph, utilizing the graph and node features constructed in the previous steps. This process is similar to the training conducted for the artist graph but specifically tailored to predict links between paintings based on their visual embeddings.
<p></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Forward pass:</strong> The node features (image embeddings) are passed through the GNN model to compute embeddings for each painting. Positive and negative edge scores are calculated using the model's prediction function.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Loss computation:</strong> A loss function compares the predicted scores against the ground truth, guiding the model's optimization.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Backward pass and optimization:</strong> Gradients are calculated with respect to the loss, and the optimizer updates the model's parameters to minimize the loss.
  </li>
</ul>
The training process iterates for 100 epochs, logging the loss every 5 epochs:

<h3>Unified Knowledge Graph</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>Combining Artist and Painting Graphs into a Unified Knowledge Graph</h4>
<p>We started by constructing two separate graphs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Artist Graph:</strong> Artist biographies were converted into vectors of size <code>384</code> using a transformer model, followed by GNN link prediction, which transformed these embeddings into vectors of size <code>128</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Painting Graph:</strong> Paintings were represented as vectors of size <code>2048</code> using a pre-trained CNN model, followed by GNN link prediction, which transformed these embeddings into vectors of size <code>128</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next Step:</strong> We will combine the Artist graph and Painting graph into a unified Knowledge Graph. This Knowledge Graph (suggested name: <code>ArtKnowledgeGraph</code>) will map painting nodes to their corresponding artist nodes. The node features for this unified graph will be represented by vectors of size <code>128</code>, ensuring a consistent embedding space across all node types.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>To create a unified Knowledge Graph, we need to ensure that nodes from both the Artist graph and the Painting graph have unique indices. This adjustment is achieved by offsetting the indices of the Artist nodes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Unique indexing:</strong> Since the Painting graph contains 1000 nodes (indexed from <code>0</code> to <code>999</code>), we add an offset of <code>1000</code> to the indices of the Artist nodes. This ensures that Artist node indices start from <code>1000</code> and do not overlap with Painting node indices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prepare adjusted Artist nodes:</strong> After offsetting the indices, the Artist nodes are prepared with the updated <code>nodeIdx</code> and their corresponding names. These are then included in the unified Knowledge Graph.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

Knowledge Graph nodes: head and tail

</a>
<p></p>


Painting nodes are prepared for the unified Knowledge Graph by mapping each painting to its corresponding artist and assigning unique artist indices.
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Load painting nodes:The painting graph nodes are loaded from a CSV file, and the column <code>file_name</code> is renamed to <code>name</code> for consistency.
  </li>
  <li>
    Map paintings to artists: A new column, <code>artist_name</code>, is created by extracting the artist's name from the painting's file name. This assumes the artist's name is the first two words in the file name, separated by underscores.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assign unique artist indices: An <code>artist_index</code> column is created by dividing the painting node index (<code>Node</code>) by 20 (integer division) and adding an offset of <code>1000</code>. This ensures unique indexing for artists across the graph.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To establish connections between painting nodes and their corresponding artist nodes, edges are created by matching paintings to artists based on their indices:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Find matching artist nodes:</strong> For each painting node, the <code>artist_index</code> is used to identify the matching artist node in <code>artist_graph_nodes</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Create edges:</strong> For each match, an edge is added between the painting node and the artist node. These edges represent the relationship between a painting and its creator.</li>
  <li><strong>Convert edges to DataFrame:</strong> The resulting edges are stored in a DataFrame with <code>Source</code> and <code>Target</code> columns, representing the painting and artist nodes, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following code implements this process:</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
The unified Knowledge Graph is created by combining nodes and edges from the Painting and Artist graphs. Painting nodes and Artist nodes are concatenated into a single DataFrame, ensuring all nodes are represented. Similarly, edges between paintings and their artists (painting_artist_graph_edges) and edges within the Artist graph (artist_graph_edges) are concatenated into a single DataFrame of edges. The resulting Knowledge Graph contains 1218 edges, ready for further graph-based processing and analysis.

<h4>Transforming the Unified Graph to DGL Format</h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
The Knowledge Graph is constructed as a DGL graph object. The edges from knowledge_graph_edges are transformed into a PyTorch tensor to define the connections between nodes. These edges are used to create a DGL graph, and self-loops are added to ensure that each node is connected to itself, which can improve GNN performance. The node features are represented by knowledge_graph_embeddings, with each node having a 128-dimensional feature vector. The resulting graph contains 1050 nodes and 2268 edges, making it ready for graph-based learning tasks.

<h4>GNN Link Prediction Model for Unified Knowledge Graph</h4>

<p></p>
<p>The final phase of training involves running the GNN link prediction model for 2000 epochs. During each epoch, the model performs a forward pass to compute node embeddings, calculates scores for positive and negative edges, and computes the loss. Gradients are backpropagated to update model parameters, optimizing the model for link prediction. Progress is logged every 100 epochs, showing the loss to monitor convergence.</p>
<p>After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set. Positive and negative edge scores are computed, and the AUC (Area Under the Curve) metric is used to assess the model's ability to distinguish between true and false links. The final AUC score achieved is <code>0.9007</code>, indicating strong predictive performance.</p>

<h2>Interpreting GNN Link Prediction Model Results</h2>

<p>The results of the GNN Link Prediction (LP) model go beyond merely predicting links; they generate <em>embedded vectors</em> for each node in the Unified Knowledge Graph. These vectors, consistent in size, provide high-dimensional representations of the nodes, capturing both contextual and relational information. Such embeddings enable advanced analysis using techniques like <em>cosine similarity</em>, <em>clustering</em>, and <em>building new graph layers</em>, offering deeper insights into the structure and relationships within the graph.</p>

<p>The Unified Knowledge Graph in this study consists of <strong>50 artist nodes</strong> and <strong>1000 painting nodes</strong>, all encoded as vectors of size 128. The GNN LP model ensures a consistent embedding space across all nodes, enabling seamless analysis and comparisons between different node types.</p>

<p>In this section, we explore two main areas of interpretation:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Artist-artist relationships:</strong> Examining similarities in the embedded vectors to identify shared themes, influences, or overlapping artistic philosophies.</li>
    <li><strong>Painting-painting connections:</strong> Analyzing stylistic or contextual similarities between paintings through their embeddings.</li>
</ul>

By focusing on embeddings rather than direct link predictions, this study highlights the ability of GNN models to uncover nuanced patterns and provide a deeper understanding of the complex relationships within the art world.

<p></p>
<h3>Model Results Analysis</h3>
<p></p>
In this step, we calculate the cosine similarity between all pairs of nodes in the Unified Knowledge Graph using their embedded vectors. The similarity scores, generated by a PyTorch function, quantify the relationships between nodes based on their high-dimensional embeddings.
<p></p>
The result is stored in a DataFrame containing 1,102,500 rows, representing all possible pairs of 1,050 nodes (50 artists and 1,000 paintings). Each row includes the indices of the two nodes and their corresponding similarity score, which serves as the foundation for analyzing relationships between nodes in the graph.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This step enhances the similarity DataFrame by joining node information from the Unified Knowledge Graph. For each pair of indices (<code>idx1</code> and <code>idx2</code>), node metadata such as names and types are added, providing contextual information about the nodes involved in each similarity computation.</p>

<p>Key steps include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Joining node information:</strong> The <code>idx1</code> and <code>idx2</code> columns are matched with the <code>nodeIdx</code> column in the Knowledge Graph nodes DataFrame, adding relevant details about each node.</li>
    <li><strong>Renaming columns:</strong> After the join, node metadata (<code>nodeName</code> and <code>nodeType</code>) is renamed to <code>node1_name</code>, <code>node1_type</code>, <code>node2_name</code>, and <code>node2_type</code> for clarity.</li>
    <li><strong>Dropping redundant columns:</strong> Extra columns from the join (<code>nodeIdx_x</code> and <code>nodeIdx_y</code>) are removed, keeping the DataFrame clean and focused on relevant information.</li>
</ul>

<p>The resulting DataFrame includes enriched details about each pair of nodes, laying the groundwork for deeper analysis of relationships within the graph.</p>

<h4>Cosine Similarity Score Distributions</h4>

<p>The GNN Link Prediction model generates similarity scores for each pair of nodes in the Unified Knowledge Graph. These scores represent the relationships between nodes and provide insights into the structure and connections within the graph.</p>


<p>For all node pairs, excluding self-loops, scores range from -0.515 to 1.000, with a mean of approximately 0.460. This indicates that many pairs exhibit moderate similarity, while higher scores highlight stronger relationships.</p>

<p>This analysis explores the distribution of cosine similarity scores for painting-painting pairs. The scores are grouped into intervals ranging from -1.0 to 1.0 in steps of 0.1. Data is filtered to include only painting-painting connections, and a histogram visualizes the frequency of pairs within each interval. The results highlight a concentration of pairs in higher intervals (e.g., <code>0.9-1.0</code>), suggesting strong stylistic or thematic similarities between many paintings. In contrast, lower intervals reveal fewer connections, emphasizing weaker or negative correlations.</p>

<h3>Painting-Painting Connections</h3>
<p>This section focuses on analyzing connections between paintings based on their similarity scores, emphasizing relationships that span across different artists. By filtering and enriching the DataFrame, we can better understand how paintings from various artists relate to one another.</p>

<p>Key steps include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Filtering painting-painting pairs:</strong> Rows where both nodes are of type <code>painting</code> are extracted, creating a subset of the data that exclusively examines relationships between paintings.</li>
    <li><strong>Extracting artist names:</strong> For each painting, the artist’s name is derived from the file name by splitting the string and capturing the relevant segment. The artist names are stored in new columns <code>artist1</code> and <code>artist2</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-artist connections:</strong> Connections between paintings created by different artists are identified by filtering for pairs where <code>artist1</code> is not equal to <code>artist2</code>. Additionally, only unique pairs are retained by ensuring <code>idx1 &lt; idx2</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
The resulting DataFrame highlights cross-artist painting relationships, providing insights into stylistic or thematic similarities between works by different creators.</p>

<p>To better understand the nature of artist connections, a new column, <code>edge_type</code>, was introduced to classify relationships into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Genre:</strong> When artists share a common artistic style or movement.</li>
  <li><strong>Nationality:</strong> When artists belong to the same country.</li>
  <li><strong>Both:</strong> When artists share both genre and nationality.</li>
  <li><strong>None:</strong> When no direct connection exists in the provided metadata.</li>
</ul>

<p>This categorization offers valuable insights into the nature of artist-artist relationships, helping uncover patterns and anomalies within the graph.</p>

To better understand the relationship between edge types and their corresponding similarity scores, we use a boxplot. The plot is arranged in the following order: both, genre, nationality, and none, ensuring consistency and clarity. A uniform light gray color is applied to all boxes for a clean and professional appearance.

<p></p>

<p>In this analysis, we focus on understanding the relationships between artist nodes by exploring similarity scores for different edge types. By examining both high and low scores, we gain insights into hidden connections and variations among artists.</p>


<p></p>

<h4>Low Scores with 'Both'</h4>
<p>Even when artists share both genre and nationality, low similarity scores reveal nuanced differences. These pairs demonstrate the diversity that can exist even within closely related artistic and cultural contexts.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
With the exception of Titian and Leonardo da Vinci, all pairs are French artists from Impressionism or Post-Impressionism, yet their low cosine similarity scores highlight nuanced stylistic differences within these closely related movements.

<p></p>


<p></p>
<h4>Low Scores with 'Nationality'</h4>
<p>Artists sharing the same nationality but exhibiting weak similarities highlight diversity within a shared cultural framework. These cases may represent unique interpretations or individualistic approaches despite shared backgrounds.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
The low cosine similarity scores between artists of the same nationality often reflect differences in time periods and artistic movements. For example, Rembrandt and Piet Mondrian represent vastly different eras—17th-century Baroque and 20th-century Abstract art—while Camille Pissarro and Eugene Delacroix belong to distinct movements like Impressionism and Romanticism. These temporal and stylistic disparities highlight the diversity within shared cultural backgrounds.
<p></p>


<p></p>
<h4>Low Scores with 'Genre'</h4>
<p>For artist pairs connected by the same genre but showing low similarity scores, we explore how artists within a single genre can differ significantly in their styles, techniques, or approaches to art.</p>

<p></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="n">low_scores_genre</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">df</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">df</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">edge_type</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">genre</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">df</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">idx2</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">df</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">idx1</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">])]</span>

<p></p>
For artists connected by the same genre, even the lowest cosine similarity scores are relatively high, indicating a baseline level of shared characteristics. However, these pairs still highlight stylistic diversity within the same genre, such as the contrasting approaches of Eugene Delacroix and William Turner in Romanticism or the differences between Albrecht Dürer and Hieronymus Bosch in the Northern Renaissance.


<p></p>

<h4>High Scores with 'None'</h4>
<p>Artists with no shared genre or nationality but high similarity scores reveal unexpected connections. These relationships may indicate shared influences, overlapping themes, or stylistic similarities that are not captured by explicit attributes.</p>

These high scores, despite no overlaps in genre or nationality, suggest deeper, unrecognized influences or thematic and stylistic parallels that transcend traditional classifications, warranting further exploration. One such connection is between Pablo Picasso (1881–1973), the Spanish pioneer of Cubism, and Mikhail Vrubel (1856–1910), a Russian Symbolist painter. Although they lived in different periods and represented contrasting artistic movements, a historical link bridges their work. In 1906, Sergey Diaghilev brought Vrubel’s works to Paris, where they captured the admiration of a young Pablo Picasso.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This study presented a Unified Knowledge Graph framework that combines text and image data to explore artistic relationships. By utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for embedding and link prediction, we uncovered meaningful connections within and across artist and painting nodes, revealing both expected patterns and surprising insights.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Key findings include:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cross-Artist Painting Connections:</strong> Identified thematic overlaps and stylistic diversity between works created by different artists.</li>
  <li><strong>Artist-Specific Variations:</strong> Highlighted the evolution and experimentation within individual artists' portfolios, showcasing their creative range.</li>
  <li><strong>Unexpected Influences:</strong> Discovered surprising connections, such as historical links between Pablo Picasso and Mikhail Vrubel, demonstrating the broader potential of this approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Unified Knowledge Graph provides a powerful tool for analyzing complex datasets, offering fresh perspectives on art history. It also paves the way for applications in recommendation systems, classification tasks, and cultural analysis. Future work will focus on expanding the graph with additional data types and improving model interpretability.
